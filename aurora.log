INFO:root:Command received: whether in rampur
INFO:root:AI response: The phrase "whether in rampur" is unclear and seems incomplete. It might be a typo or an incomplete question.  - If you meant **"weather in Rampur"**, you're likely asking about the current or typical weather conditions in Rampur (a city in Uttar Pradesh, India). The weather varies by season: hot summers (up to 40°C), monsoon rains (July–September), and cool winters (down to 5°C). - If you meant **"whether in Rampur"**, the context is missing (e.g., "whether [something exists/happens] in Rampur").  For a precise answer, please clarify or rephrase your question.

If you meant **"git pipe"**, it likely refers to using Git (version control system) with shell pipes (`|`) for command chaining (e.g., `git log | grep "commit"`).  If you meant **"GitHub"**, it’s a platform for Git repositories.  For clarity, please specify the context (e.g., Git commands, GitHub, or shell scripting).

For example: - If asking about time: "It is [current time]." - If asking about a decision: "Please clarify what you are deciding."
